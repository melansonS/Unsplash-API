# Unsplash Search Display

A simple re-implementation of some of the features provided by the Unsplash API.
Built using HTML, CSS, React, Sass and Unsplash's awesome API: https://unsplash.com/developers

The API call return images relevant to the user's search query and loads them into a *dynamically generated fully responsive masonry layout.* The images are retrieved procedurally as the user scrolls through the images. Each image provides a link to the original poster's Unsplash Profile and a download link.
